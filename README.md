# iOS9-Development

These are my very first attemps at building simple apps in iOS 9 through Rob Percival's 
"The Complete iOS 9 Developer Course". The course is mostly UI based, so it won't go into much explanation on the concept side - in case you'd be interested.

This repository is useful for implementing basic features, that will eventually lead onto the making of Snapchat, Uber and Instagram.
